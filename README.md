## Project Summary

In this project, we are presenting a mobile application that assists the public to find parking  slots in a modern way. It makes use of cameras in the parking lot to check the availability of an empty parking space. Using this application, the person will be able to find slots nearby without being present in that area. This will help the person to check whether there is an available parking slot in that area and will be able to know the hourly rate price. This will enable the public to use their time efficiently as well as reduce the amount of parking flow in the parking area because people will see beforehand and therefore will be more cautious about parking there at a given time.
